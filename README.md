## Maze

This project implements a maze solver and generator using Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms.

### Part 1: Queue Implementation
- Implement a Queue data structure using doubly linked lists.

### Part 2: Maze Class
- The Maze class contains methods for maze initialization, drawing, generation using DFS, and solving using BFS.

### Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Both search algorithms are utilized for exploring the maze and finding solutions.

### Maze Generation (DFS)
- Generate a maze using Depth First Search algorithm.

### Maze Solving (BFS)
- Solve the maze using Breadth First Search algorithm, ensuring finding the shortest path from start to finish.

### Animation
- The code supports creating animations of the maze solution.
